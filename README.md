# Intelligent Receipt Processing System Using AWS

## üìå Overview  
In today‚Äôs digitally driven world, organizing paper receipts is still a challenge. This cloud-native solution automates the end-to-end receipt processing workflow by leveraging the power of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. From uploading a receipt to receiving a clean summary in your inbox, this system eliminates manual sorting through smart orchestration of AWS services.

## üöÄ Features
- Flask-based web interface hosted on **Amazon EC2**
- Secure file upload to **Amazon S3**
- Automatic data extraction via **Amazon Textract**
- Data storage in **Amazon DynamoDB**
- Email summaries sent via **Amazon SES**
- Fully serverless and event-driven architecture

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Components
### 1. **Frontend (User Interface)**
- Built with **Flask**, running on an **EC2 instance**
- Users upload receipt images or PDFs
- EC2 resides in a **VPC** for secure access

### 2. **Storage**
- Uploaded receipts go directly to an **S3 bucket**

### 3. **Trigger & Compute**
- S3 upload triggers an **AWS Lambda** function
- Lambda has IAM permissions to access S3, Textract, DynamoDB, and SES

### 4. **Text Extraction**
- Lambda invokes **Amazon Textract** for OCR and structured data extraction

### 5. **Database**
- Parsed receipt data is stored in **DynamoDB** with schema optimized for queries

### 6. **Notifications**
- Lambda sends out automated summaries or confirmations using **Amazon SES**

## üîí Security Considerations
- IAM roles adhere to the **principle of least privilege**
- EC2, Lambda, and S3 are tightly controlled via **IAM policies** and **VPC settings**

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate IAM credentials
- Python 3.9+ installed
- AWS account with access to EC2, S3, Lambda, Textract, DynamoDB, and SES

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajendramahesh/Intelligent-Receipt-Processing-System-Using-AWS.git
   cd Intelligent-Receipt-Processing-System-Using-AWS
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS services**
   - Set up the EC2 instance and deploy your Flask app
   - Create S3 bucket for file storage
   - Create and deploy Lambda with appropriate IAM roles
   - Set up DynamoDB table and configure SES for emails

4. **Run the Flask app**
